# Linux-Partition

# First check the list of available partitions on your device

df -h

# Now suppose if we want to shrink ext4 partition which is located in sda3, we do the following steps
  1. umount /dev/sda3 (unmounting the /home partition: make sure you're logged in as root)
  2. e2fsck -f /dev/sda3 (do a filesystem check on the partition. If the filesystem check is successful proceed with next step)
  3. resize2fs /dev/sda3 4G (specify the new size for the partition which is lesser then your current partition size)
  4. fdisk /dev/sda (1. Delete the entry from the partition table d;
                     2. Create new partition n;
                     3. Specify the new size, same as the one mentioned before [4G]
                     4. Save the changes and exit)
# Make sure your first sector is same in the above process.
5. partprobe OR reboot (to update your partition table)
6. mount /dev/sda3
